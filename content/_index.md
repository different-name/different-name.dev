# different-name.dev

**Welcome to my dev blog!**

Here is where I share anything and everything I'm interested in and what I'm currently working on.

If you're interested in seeing what keeps me busy in my spare time, you'll find a mix of experiments,discoveries, thoughts and learning experiences as I go down various rabbit holes.

While this blog is more of my own personal log than any kind of tutorial, I hope it demonstrates the process of continuous learning and curiosity that drives software development.

## Current projects

### NixOS

I'm currently exploring NixOS, a Linux operating system build around Nix, a declarative package manager. My NixOS configuration files are publicly available at [github:different-name/nix-files](https://github.com/different-name/nix-files). View my posts related to NixOS [here](/tags/nixos)

### Time Pilot DMG

A passion project of mine, porting my favourite arcade game [Time Pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Pilot) to the original Game Boy. This project is written in C using the [GBDK-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) development kit, and is 100% compatible with the original DMG Game Boy, using real cartridges. The project files are available at [github:different-name/time-pilot-dmg](https://github.com/different-name/time-pilot-dmg).

### Hand wired split keyboard

I'm currently finishing up my hand wired keyboard! More info and pictures coming soon in a blog post, but it's fully hand wired and running QMK with a 3D printed case.
